Instructions below assume 'go' is installed on your system and that system follows a
*nix/bash command line format.

To build, clone this repository then build with:
    go build knapsack.go

That should produce a local file called "knapsack" in your directory.  To run, enter:
    ./knapsack [weight]
    -- where [weight] is an integer value

The output will be the value contained within the knapsack, the list of items in the
knapsack, and the total weight when all is said and done.

The way the data is layed out, the following should provide interesting results:
    ./knapsack 18  -- which will fill the backpack with 17 pounds at a value of 43
    ./knapsack 5   -- which will take item1 and 2a (2 will not be taken as it has a lower value)
    ./knapsack 9   -- which will take item1 and 4 (3 has an equal weight but lesser value)
    ./knapsack 1   -- won't take anything
